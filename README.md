# Store-Manage-Rest-API-Improved
This project is a RESTful API built with Flask to manage stores and items. It provides endpoints to perform CRUD operations on stores and their items, allowing users to view, add, and retrieve specific stores and items by their unique identifiers. The API uses uuid to generate unique IDs for stores and items.
